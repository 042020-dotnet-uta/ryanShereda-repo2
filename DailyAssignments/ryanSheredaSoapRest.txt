1. Why was SOAP created?
- To reduce code smells
- To provide a simple way to implement networking between classes
- To define how web services talk to client applications or other services ***
- To create a diverse language that applications can develop for

2. Which of the following is not an advantage of SOAP?
- Provides a common language between web services and client applications
- Lightweight protocol used for data interchange between applications
- Works on HTTP protocol
- Designed to be platform and system dependent ***

3. SOAP Messages are:
- Normally auto-generated by the web service when called ***
- Normally manually created by the end user
- Normally manually created by the scripter
- Normally auto-generated by the client request when sent

4. Which of the following is not a valid faultCode?
- SOAP-ENV:VersionMismatch
- SOAP-ENV:Misunderstand ***
- SOAP-ENV:Client
- SOAP-ENV:Server

5. Why is XML used as the language of choice for SOAP and other cross-language interaction?
- It is the easiest to understand when written
- It is innately understood by all systems ***
- It is lightweight, running under any other code without trouble
- It is clean, free of underlying bugs or errors

1. What is the purpose of the PATCH method in a RESTful application?
- Creates a new resurce at the specified URI
- Performs a partial update of the resource at the specified URI ***
- Either creates or replaces the resource at the specified URI
- Removes and recreates the resource at the specified URI

2. What status code is returned when a server doesn't support a requested media type?
- 400 Bad Request
- 406 Unacceptable
- 411 Invalid Request Type
- 415 Unsupported Media Type ***

3. What is the Halting Problem?
- The problem of determining how many times a given function will pause before completing
- The problem of determining whether a program will finish running, or continue to run forever ***
- The problem of determining how many possible end states a program can have
- The problem of determining where coders stop working on specific functions due to technical limitations 

4. Which of the following is a common characteristic in a CSRF attack?
- Involves HTML requests that have side effects
- Involves sites that rely on the user's input
- Exploits the user's trust in a site
- Tricks the user's browser into senting HTTP requests to a target site ***

5. Which of the following is not a function of a Fetch API?
- Provides a generic definition of Request and Response objects
- Provides definition for related concepts, such as CORS and HTTP origin headers
- Won't send cookies automatically
- Receives cross-site cookies ***

REST, short for Representational State Transfer, is an open standard category of web services written in ASP.NET. Client applications are able to access this API using any HTTP-compatible language or toolset. REST APIs are designed around resources that are accessible by the client, using unique identifiers and specific routing to direct requests to the correct resources. There are six guiding principles that determine if an interface is RESTful: the interface must feature loose coupling, to allow for portability and ease of switching aspects out as technology changes; the requests sent must be stateless and atomic, able to stand on their own; responses are labeled as cacheable or non-cacheable, depending on if the client should be allowed to reuse the data; the interfaces are uniform and generalized; the system has a hierarchical structure, limiting vision of components to the layer they interact with; and the interface must be extendable in functionality through the addition of scripts. Beyond these principles, there are four levels used to determine the extent of how RESTful a site is. The first level involves using a single URI, and using strictly POST requests to interact with it. The second evolves through the use of multiple URIs depending on the resource in question. The third uses HTTP methods such as GET, POST, and DELETE to define the operations used on the resources. The fourth and final level involves using hypermedia to extent the HTTP methods to encompass relevant informational operations for each resource. While only the highest level is truly considered RESTful, most sites fall into the next highest category, and as such has been deemed a reasonable level of RESTfulness.

Web services act as asynchronous online applications, invokable by any suitable client using remote procedure calls. They are written using XML due to the universal nature of the language, meaning any client regardless of platform or system is able to interact with the web service. The standard structure for the interaction between web service and client is the Simple Object Access Protocol, an XML document with standard structure, sent via HTTP. SOAP serves as an intermediate language, providing guidelines on how web services and client applications area ble to interact, through all permutations and combinations. SOAP serves to impose some degree of convention upon the XML documents used to facilitate data exchange. All data exchanges performed through SOAP are, fittingly, called SOAP messages. These messages are comprised of a couple different elements: the envelope, the body/bodies, an optional header, and an optional fault management block. The envelope, a required element, encompasses all other parts of the message, defining the message as a SOAP message through definition about versioning. The body contains the data being sent via the message--as a result, this portion of the message is (understandably) required. The header, while optional, can contain authentication credentials, as well as complex data type definitions that are needed alongside the body of the message. The fault block provides a defined path for any errors that may occur during the process, reporting them back to the user.
